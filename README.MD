# 📂 Database Indexing – Explained with Django ORM

This repository covers the fundamentals of **database indexing**, why it’s important, how it helps speed up queries, and how you can use it effectively in your Django projects.

---

## ✅ What is Database Indexing?

A **database index** is like the index of a book—it helps the database find the data you’re searching for quickly without scanning every row. It’s a special data structure that stores pointers to records, improving query performance.

---

## 📚 Why Do We Need Indexes?

- Without an index, the database performs a **full table scan**, checking each row one by one.
- With an index, the database jumps directly to the matching rows → **faster queries**
- Indexes are especially important for:
  - Searching
  - Filtering
  - Sorting
  - Joining tables

## ✅ Types of Indexes

| Index Type      | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| ✅ Primary Key Index | Automatically created for the primary key column |
| ✅ Unique Index      | Ensures values in a column are unique |
| ✅ Non-Unique Index  | Speeds up lookups but allows duplicates |
| ✅ Composite Index   | Index on multiple columns for combined filtering |
| ✅ Full-text Index   | Optimizes searching through text fields |

---

## ✅ Real-world Use Cases

✔ Searching users by email or username  
✔ Filtering orders by date or status  
✔ Joining tables like employees and departments  
✔ Sorting products by price or rating

## ✅ Indexing in Django ORM

Django provides indexing support in its model definitions:

### 📦 Primary Key & Foreign Keys
- Automatically indexed  
- Speeds up joins and lookups

### 📦 Unique Indexes

```python
email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
```
➡ Ensures uniqueness in the database

📦 Custom Indexes
```
class Employee(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    department = models.ForeignKey(Department, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)

    class Meta:
        indexes = [
            models.Index(fields=['name']),
            models.Index(fields=['department', 'name']),
        ]
```
➡ Creates a simple index on name and a composite index on department + name


---

✅ Best Practices

✔ Add indexes only to columns frequently used in filters, joins, or sorting
✔ Use unique=True when you need uniqueness constraints
✔ Use select_related() or prefetch_related() together with indexes for optimized queries
✔ Avoid unnecessary indexes – they consume storage and slow down write operations


---

✅ Summary

- Indexes improve query performance by allowing quick lookups

- Django automatically adds indexes on primary and foreign keys

- You can define additional indexes using the Meta class

- Indexes are crucial for scaling applications with large datasets

- Use them thoughtfully to balance speed and storage efficiency
